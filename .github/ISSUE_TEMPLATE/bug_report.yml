        ## Important information
        ### Thank you for taking the time to fill out this bug report in a sensible way and provide us with a clear information on your "Software and Hardware-Setup" and the "Steps to reproduce" your problem!
        ### Please understand you are asking for support for the Docker-Image and Docker-Container. I'm NOT the creator of the Dedicated-Game-Server itself, i'm not involved in programming that. If you need help for that, you might want to ask here for topics related to that: https://tech.palworldgame.com/getting-started/deploy-dedicated-server
